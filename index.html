  <h3 class="center">About Me</h3>
   
      <p class="center">
        Senior in college with a passion for writing and pushing high-quality code, designing and implementing features to improve various systems,<br> and two years of experience working closely with languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, React.js, jQuery,<br> looking for an internship in Software development/engineering. Currently, I am a Senior attending Norwich University pursuing a <br>Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity with an emphasis in computer forensics and vulnerability management.

I have always been drawn to technology <br> and became interested in things related to computer programming and products when I was a child. With that interest, <br> I attended and won numerous hackathons sponsored by companies like Motorola, AWS, Febreze, and Microsoft. The products I have created/developed <br> in these hackathons have also been featured on technology news sites such as Techcrunch. In addition, I have worked for companies such as Sage Intacct,<br> Spartacus, Sandora, and Green Tracking Services.
